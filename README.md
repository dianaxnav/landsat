# Monitoring the distribution and change in land cover types in South Santa Barbara

The purpose of this repository is to form a supervised classification, a decision tree classifier to classify pixels using a series of conditions based on values in spectral bands. These conditions are developed based on training data. Doing this can help understand the impacts of phenomena like climate change, natural disasters, deforestation, and urbanization.
